# pwsh
For the truly misc. scripts

## auto-dark-mode.ps1
PowerShell script to set as a Scheduled Task, for changing your system and app theme to light mode during the day, and to dark mode during nighttime and twilight hours. It favors dark mode slightly, for preserving your eyes.

## ConvertTo-AsciiArt
Image to "ASCII" (definitely not ASCII) artwork. Uses a nebulous brightness comparison and produces blobby results. Some characters used may not be safe or display properly, even in monospace. Working well in Windows Terminal, for starters.
